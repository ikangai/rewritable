# re-write-able

*A single HTML file that renders, modifies, and commits itself — the document that owns its own format.*

---

**re** — it does it again. The agent loop, self-modification, iteration over time.
**write** — not read. Not consume. Author. The read/write web, finally delivered.
**able** — a property of the file itself. Not a permission the OS grants you. Something it *is*.

## What it is

A re-writeable file is a `.html` file that:

1. **Renders itself** — open it in any browser, it runs
2. **Stores itself** — its working state lives in IndexedDB; the file itself is the durable record
3. **Modifies itself** — an embedded agent rewrites the document on instruction
4. **Commits itself** — the current state is written back into the file, in place when the browser allows it, as a download otherwise
5. **Requires nothing** — no server, no install, no build step, no account

The user-authored content is a **document** — sometimes pure prose, sometimes a tracker, sometimes a spreadsheet, often all three at once. Word, Excel, and PowerPoint each picked one mode and made the others awkward; HTML does all three in the same file. `re-write-able` returns the document to the form factor that made office suites work in the first place: a file you own, on disk, that you can send.

## How it works

Open the file in a browser. It's a document the moment it opens — no build screen, no agent call, no waiting. The shipped file already contains a snapshot of its own initial state. From that point:

- `Cmd+K` — tell the document to change itself
- `Cmd+Z` — undo (up to 10 levels)
- `Cmd+S` — commit the current state back into the file (write-in-place on Chromium; download elsewhere)

The file is built around an **immutable bootstrap** — a loader, a runtime, and a frozen snapshot of the document — and a **mutable working copy** that lives in IndexedDB. The agent only sees the document; it never sees the runtime. On commit, the bootstrap is rewritten with an updated snapshot, and only the snapshot changes.

Send the file by email, put it on a USB stick, commit it to git. The recipient opens it in a browser and it runs.
